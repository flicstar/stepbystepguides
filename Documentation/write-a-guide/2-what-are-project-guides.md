# What are project guides?

A project guide is made up of multiple step-by-step guides. 

Project guides help learners complete multi-part processes by combining individual tasks into a coherent whole. They provide a clear learning sequence and maintain a narrative that shows how the parts fit together.

## How project guides extend step-by-step guides

Project guides compose several atomic step-by-step guides into a larger or more advanced outcome. 

Use a project guide when: 

* Multiple distinct tasks are required  
* Some tasks are already covered in other guides  
* It would take more than 30 minutes or feel overwhelming as one block

**Examples**

* Build a multilingual site  
* Develop a custom frontend plugin with user authentication

## Project guides are modular

Project guides follow the same template as regular step-by-step guides, the only difference is that the Task section looks a bit different.

Project guides are **fully modular**. They are made entirely by linking out to existing step-by-step guides, like ingredients in a recipe.

You should only create a project guide once all the step-by-step guides it depends on have been created. This helps avoid incomplete or blocked project guides.

*Exception*: In rare cases, an author may find that some procedural steps don’t justify a standalone guide — perhaps because they’re too minor, too specific, or only make sense in the context of the larger flow. In these situations, it may be appropriate to include a small number of inline steps within a project guide. Use this approach only when a task truly cannot stand alone.
